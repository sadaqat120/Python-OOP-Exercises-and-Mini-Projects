------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem No. 1
Write a program which will keep on taking an integer as input from the user 
continuously. All positive integers input by the user need to be added in a variable 
called positives. All negative integers input by the user need to be added in a 
variable called negatives. This process should continue until the user enters 0. Then
both of the sums should be shown separately. It should also check whether |
negatives| is greater than or smaller than positives. To compute |negatives|, you 
are not allowed to use any pre-defined function.


                                       Program Coded:


positives = 0
negatives = 0
a = int(input("Enter any number..."))
while ( a != 0):
 if (a > 0):
 positives += a
 elif (a < 0):
 negatives += a
 a = int(input("Enter any number..."))
negatives *= -1
if positives > negatives:
 print ("The Variable positives is greater which is ", positives)
else:
 print ("The Variable negatives is greater which is ", negatives)

Problem No. 2
Write a program which will take an integer from the user as input and store it in n. It
should output nth Fibonacci number. First two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1. 

                                                             Program Coded:

n = int(input("Enter the number..."))
a = 0
b = 1
c = 2
d = 0
while ( n > 0 and c <= n):
    a = b
    b = d
    d = b + a
    c += 1
print (d)
if n <= 0:
    print ("Invalid number, Counting starts from 1...")

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 03: 
Modify the solution of Problem No. 2 and display the complete Fibonacci series till nth element.

                                                                  Program Coded:

n = int(input("Enter the number..."))
a = 0
b = 1
c = 1
d = 0
while ( n > 0 and c <= n):
    print (d)
    a = b
    b = d
    d = b + a
    c += 1
if n <= 0:
    print ("Invalid number, Counting starts from 1...")

Problem No. 4 
Write a Python program which will take an integer as input and compute its factorial. 

                                                                 Program Coded:

a = int(input("Enter any number for it's factorial..."))
e = a
b = a - 1
while ( b > 0):
 if (b > 0):
 e *= b
 b -= 1
if (a == 1 or a == 0):
 print ("Factorial of your given number is 1")
if (e > 1):
 print ("Factorial of your given number is ", e)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem No. 5
Write a program that prints all unique combinations of 1, 2 and 3. For example, 123,
321, 231 etc.    
-->
This is not solved...                                                             
	As I'm unable to do it Without list and according to rule, list not allowed at any cost... <--
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem No. 6
Write a program which will take an input from the user named as countPrimes and 
will print first countPrimes prime numbers. 


                                                                 Program Coded:

countPrimes = int(input("Enter a number..."))
a = 1
e = 1
while (e <= countPrimes):
    b = 2
    d = True
    while ( b < a):
        if (a%b == 0):
            d = False
        b += 1
    if d == True:
        print(a)
        e += 1
    a += 1

Problem No. 7
Write a program to print the following pattern. You canâ€™t use more than one * in a 
print statement. Use while and if statements where needed. 


                                                                 Program Coded:

a = 9
r = 0
while (a > 0):
    b = a
    while (b > 0):
        print ("*",end=" ")
        b -= 1
    print()
    e = -1
    while (e < r and a>1 ):
        print (end="  ")
        e += 1
    a -= 2
    r += 1
a = 3
r = 3
while (a <=9):
    b = a
    e = 0
    while (e < r):
        print(end="  ")
        e += 1
    while (b > 0):
        print ("*",end=" ")
        b -= 1
    print()
    a += 2
    r -= 1
